# ðŸ“š GraphQL Library

## Overview

GraphQL Library is a full stack web application which allows users to make reading lists, and serves as an introduction to creating and interacting with a GraphQL API

This project is basically a fork of [graphql-playlist](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/graphql-playlist) and, thus, closely follows the [GraphQL with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q&list=WL&index=5&t=0s) course from freeCodeCamp â€“ except I'm using newer GraphQL Schema syntax, etc

This is mostly just a personal exploratory project, but if you'd like to use it as a guide, boilerplate, etc, then continue reading :~)

## Getting Started

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.org)
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
3. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
4. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and, optionally, the MongoDB GUI, [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
5. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/darkhist/graphql-library.git`
6. `cd graphql-library`

## Client Development

The frontend for this project was scaffolded with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

See [here](client/README.md) for details!

_I'm using Prettier for code formatting, so if you hate that just remove the Prettier development dependency_

## Server Development

1. In a fresh Terminal tab, run `mongod` to start MongoDB
2. Switch to a new tab
3. `cd server`
4. Install dependencies by running `yarn`
5. Start the server with `yarn start`
6. Visit http://localhost:9000/api

_GraphiQL is an interactive GraphQL IDE, and it's great for testing queries and exploring your API documentation_

_I'm using Nodemon to automatically reload the server when files change, so if you hate that too just remove the Nodemon development dependency_
